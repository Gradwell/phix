<h1>DBLite - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="s">
<h2>1. Installation and Getting Started</h2>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>1.1. The Perl library XML::LibXML has a lot of dependancies like
XML::SAX and so on. Should I install them all, or can I skip them?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>DBLite tools are written in Perl and have some dependancies not
included in this package. Those dependancies are Perl modules which
themselves have dependancies. We recommend you install everything the
modules call for. Read the documentation on installing perl modules
with the command <span class="c">perldoc perlmodinstall</span>. You
can determine what modules are already install on your system with the
command <span class="c">perldoc perllocal</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>1.2. There are a lot of tools here. Is there documentation for
them?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>Yes. For an overview of the tools, read the file <i>README</i>. For
more specific information about each tool, go into the <i>bin</i>
directory and type <span class="c">perldoc sometool</span>, where
<i>sometool</i> is the name of the tool you want to know more
about.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>1.3. Is there an example book coded in DocBook I can look at?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>Yes. It's in the <i>test/lx</i> subdirectory of the install
package.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="s">
<h2>2. Authoring</h2>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.1. How can I edit XML files with Emacs?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>Emacs supports XML as long as you stay within the ISO Latin-1
character set. It does not support UTF-8 or other encodings
yet. You will have to use character entity references for special
symbols and exotic characters (described below).</p>
<p>There is a special major mode called <i>psgmls</i> designed to make
working with XML much easier. It provides an automatic syntax checking
mechanism that reads the DTD and then scans your file while you
type. It will also automatically indent elements to make your file
easier to read. I will include detailed instructions for setting it up
soon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.2. How can I use a special character from inside a text-only
editor?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>Text-only editors like Emacs are stuck in the ISO Latin-1 character
set. Any special characters you want to use such as mathematical
symbols or accented letters or Japanese ideographs will have to be
imported using a special entity reference. There are many defined
entity references declared in the dblite DTD which you can locate in
the <i>docbook41/ent</i> subdirectory. For example, to find the name
of the entity for trademark (from the <i>dblite</i> directory:</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ grep TRADE docbook41/ent/*
docbook41/ent/iso-num.ent:&lt;!ENTITY reg "&amp;#x00AE;"> &lt;!-- REG TRADE MARK SIGN -->
docbook41/ent/iso-num.ent:&lt;!ENTITY trade "&amp;#x2122;"> &lt;!-- TRADE MARK SIGN --></pre></blockquote>
<p>So, to use the trademark character in your document, you can type
either &amp;trade; or &amp;#x2122;. The latter one will be understood
by all XML parsers even without a doctype declaration, but has the
disadvantage of being hard to remember.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.2. Are there graphical editors that will work with DBLite?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>There are many graphical editors for authoring XML. They come with
a range of features and prices. Many such editors will read the DTD
and check the elements in your document to make sure it's structured
correctly. They usually include options to hide markup to make the
text easier to read.</p>

<p>Some graphical editors rely on CSS stylesheets to format the text
so that it looks nice on screen. I've included a CSS stylesheet in the
DBLite install package that an author created for use with XMetaL.</p>

<p>Here are a few editors we have used:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Company</th><th>Name</th><th>Platform</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
<tr><td>Morphon</td><td>XML Editor</td><td>MacOS, Windows, Unix</td><td>$100</td></tr>
<tr><td>SoftQuad</td><td>XMetaL</td><td>Windows</td><td>$200</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arbortext</td><td>Adept</td><td>Windows, Solaris</td><td>$1000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you have experience with any others, please let us know so we
can recommend them to other authors.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.3. Does dblite include the equivalent of a &lt;br/&gt; element to
force a newline in prose (for instance if I want a URL to be on a
line by itself)?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>No, there is nothing like that in DocBook. However, since we
convert the book to FrameMaker in production, we can force a linebreak
then. So if you want to let the production editor know your intention
to have a linebreak at some point, you can just insert a little
comment to that effect. The &lt;remark&gt; element is for putting in
such comments.</p>
<p>In general, you don't need to worry about linebreaks or
pagebreaks. That will all be done by the production editor. However,
in certain cases you need the linebreaks for semantic reasons, such as
in a code block or a poem. &lt;programlisting&gt; and &lt;screen&gt;
are elements for code blocks and representing screen output,
respectively. &lt;literallayout&gt; is for anything else that needs to
retain spacing, such as poems.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.4. How do I insert a comment that the production editor will see?
Can I use a regular XML comment?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>Production editors don't look at the XML markup, so any comment
constructs you create will be ignored. If you want a comment to be
seen, use the &lt;remark&gt; element like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;remark&gt;Please check the spelling of the word
"farfignoogin" in the next para.&lt;/remark&gt;
&lt;para&gt;The Germans call it "farfignoogin"&lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>2.5. Are the production tools smart enough to discard filler
whitespace?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>The rules for whitespace in XML are kind of tricky, but they
<em>generally</em> do what you want.</p>
<p>In block-type elements (e.g. paragraphs, titles), leading and
trailing space will be thrown away. All other space will be collapsed
into one single space character. So this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;para&gt;     Hey     there.      &lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>will "normalize" to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;para&gt;Hey there.&lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few exceptions, noteably &lt;screen&gt;,
&lt;programlisting&gt;, and &lt;literallayout&gt; which preserve all
whitespace. (Technically, in these elements, we throw out any leading
blank lines and all trailing space, but otherwise keep all space
characters intact.)</p>
<p>In non-block (inline) elements, the leading and trailing space are
treated the same as space in the middle of content. So this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;para&gt;   I am   &lt;emphasis&gt;   very hungry
&lt;/emphasis&gt;   today.   &lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>normalizes to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;para&gt;I am &lt;emphasis&gt; very hungry &lt;/emphasis&gt; today.&lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not what we want, however, because there are effectively
two spaces between the words "am" and "very". So we usually do some
pre-processing on the XML to squeeze out space inside of inline tags
and then do the normalization step. The result is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;para&gt;I am &lt;emphasis&gt;very hungry&lt;/emphasis&gt; today.&lt;/para&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>3. Generating HTML</h2>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.1. How can I generate HTML from my XML files?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>This package contains a tool for authors to generate HTML easily
from their XML files. The command is <span class="c">db2h</span> and
it takes an XML filename as its argument. The files it generates
include an index called <i>book.html</i> and a file for each chapter
or appendix.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.2. When I run <span class="c">db2h</span> on a file, I get a lot
of error messages and no HTML file is generated. What happened?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>The most common reason is that the XML file is not
well-formed. This simply means that there is a syntax error in the XML
and the parser in <span class="c">db2h</span> has given up trying to
work with it. You need to find out where the error is located and fix
it.</p>
<p>To locate the error, run the command <span class="c">xwf</span> on
each file you want to check (not <i>book.xml</i>, but each individual
chapter and appendix file). You'll see a series of error messages like
this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ xwf test.xml
WARNING: 'test.xml' is NOT well-formed.
----------
[1] ON LINE 9 OF 'test.xml', Opening and ending tag mismatch (bar and
baz).

  EXCERPT
  &lt;bar>Hello there&lt;/baz>
                       ^</pre></blockquote>
<p>This message tells you that in the file <i>test.xml</i> on line 9,
there is an error located where the caret character is pointing. In
this case, the problem is a misspelled element end tag. For more
information about creating well-formed XML, read chapter 2 of my book
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/learnxml/"><i>Learning
XML</i></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.3. I tried running <span class="c">db2h</span> on the file
<i>ch03.xml</i> and got an error telling me "Entity 'foo' not
defined." It's well-formed XML, so what am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>The file contains entity references but no declarations for the
entities. It's like forgetting to initialize a variable. You need to
include some information in the document to tell db2h what to do with
the entity references. The way to do this is with a <i>doctype
declaration</i>. It looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE book SYSTEM "/usr/local/prod/sgml/dblite/dblite.dtd"
[
  &lt;!ENTITY foo "some replacement text here">
]></pre></blockquote>
<p>If you want to put this in a chapter file, change "book" to
"chapter" (or whatever is the type of the root element) above. The
path to <i>dblite.dtd</i> may be different, depending on where you
installed it.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that the chapter becomes an independant
document and you can't validate the whole book at once. If you want to
be able to validate the whole book, then create a file called
<i>book.xml</i> and put the doctype declaration in there. Then add
entities to import each of the chapter files like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE book SYSTEM "/usr/local/prod/sgml/dblite/dblite.dtd"
[
  &lt;!ENTITY preface "ch00.xml">
  &lt;!ENTITY ch01 "ch01.xml">
  &lt;!ENTITY ch02 "ch02.xml">
  &lt;!ENTITY appa "appa.xml">
]>
&lt;book>&lt;title>My Excellent Book&lt;/title>
&preface;
&ch00;
&ch01;
&appa;
&lt;/book></pre></blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.4. I am running <span class="c">db2h</span> on the file
<i>ch03.xml</i> and it saves the result in <i>ch01.html</i>. Why
doesn't it save it in <i>ch03.html</i>?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>This is a bug that will be fixed soon. If you want to have correct
numbering, create a <i>book.xml</i> as described in section 3.3 above,
and run <span class="c">db2h book.xml</span>. It will separate all the
chapter files with correct numbering automatically.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.5. The graphics in my book are in the PNG format. Can <span
class="c">db2h</span> handle that?</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p><span class="c">db2h</span> doesn't care about the graphic
format. It will simply transmit the file name into the HTML file
as-is. The real limitation here is what kind of browser you're
using. If it supports PNG format files, then you're fine.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="ss">
<div class="q">
<p>3.6. The character entity references resolve into a form my browser 
doesn't recognise. For example, &amp;copy; becomes &amp;#x00A9; which
doesn't display in Netscape Navigator. It should remain &amp;copy;.</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>The default character entity values are numeric unicode character
entity references, which only work for browsers that support
Unicode. If you want to fall back on more traditional HTML entity
definitions, change the DTD declaration in your document to be
<i>dblite_htmlents.dtd</i> instead of <i>dblite.dtd</i>. Some entity
references like &amp;copy; will be retained as an entity reference for
compatibility with older web browsers.</p>
